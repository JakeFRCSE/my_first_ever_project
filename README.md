This is my first project in my life ever.
I learned App Inventor during the first semester of my University life.
After the semester, I decided to make an app for my language exchange meetup.
The rules required are following.
-----
1. Input is the number of total tables which is integer.
2. The number of people assigned in a table is 4.
3. All the people in the same table should be assigned to different table.
-----
Please take it into account the fact that I was novice.

Example Screenshots are following.
