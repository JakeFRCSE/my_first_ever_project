This is the first project in my life ever.

I learned App Inventor in the first semester of university.

After the semester, I decided to make an app for my language exchange meetup.

The requirements are following.

------
1. The input is the number of total tables which is integer.

2. The number of people assigned in a table is 4 except for the last table.

3. All the people in the same table should be assigned to different table.

-----
Please take it into account the fact that I was novice.

Screenshots are following.

First version - 444 Blocks
